# VALIDATION EXPRESS - Solo Founder Checklist

**Project:** SGE - SaaS School Management System  
**Context:** Personal initiative, domain expertise-based  
**Timeline:** Feb 13-14, 2026 (1-2 days)  
**Objective:** Validate assumptions before 6-month development commitment

---

## VALIDATION APPROACH

Since this is a personal SaaS initiative and you have direct experience in the educational environment, the validation process is streamlined:

**Traditional Approach (4+ days):**
- ❌ Formal stakeholder meetings
- ❌ 6-8 formal interviews
- ❌ Approval signatures

**Solo Founder Approach (1-2 days):**
- ✅ Self-assessment of domain expertise
- ✅ 3-5 quick validation calls (15-30 min each)
- ✅ Market research (competitors, pricing)
- ✅ Personal green light decision

---

## DAY 1: THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13 (TODAY)

### ✅ Morning: Self-Assessment (COMPLETE)

**Domain Knowledge Review:**
- [x] Document business model and strategy → BUSINESS_MODEL.md created
- [ ] Review assumptions from your work experience
- [ ] Identify any knowledge gaps

**Key Assumptions to Validate Internally:**

1. **Attendance System (From Your Experience)**
   - [ ] 12 academic-equivalent lessons/day is accurate → ✅ Yes / ⚠️ Varies by school
   - [ ] Day section 7:00-16:30 is standard → ✅ / ⚠️
   - [ ] Night section 18:00-22:00 is common → ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ Not needed for MVP
   - [ ] 5 attendance statuses cover all cases → ✅ / ⚠️

2. **User Roles**
   - [ ] 5 roles (Admin, Coordinator, Teacher, Student, Parent) sufficient → ✅ / ⚠️
   - [ ] Permission matrix matches real workflows → ✅ / ⚠️

3. **Academic Structure**
   - [ ] Term/grade/group model matches MEP → ✅ / ⚠️
   - [ ] Any MEP requirements missing? → Document them

**Action:** Spend 30-60 minutes reviewing planning docs through the lens of your real-world experience. Note any red flags.

2. **Adjust MVP Scope (If Needed)**

   - [ ] Update PLAN.md if significant changes

3. **Create NFR_DETAILS.md (Optional)**
   - [ ] Define specific performance targets
   - [ ] Security policy details
   - [ ] Or defer to Sprint 1 (non-blocker)

4. **Tag Repository**
   - [ ] `git tag -a v1.0-validated -m "Market validated - Ready for MVP development"`

5. **Prepare for Monday**

**If NO-GO or MAJOR PIVOT:**

1. **Document Reasons**

   - Are they fixable or fundamental?

2. **Options:**
   - Pivot scope (smaller MVP, different market, etc.)

## APPENDIX: WHY THIS SIMPLIFIED APPROACH WORKS

**Traditional stakeholder approval is for:**
- Large organizations with formal governance
- Projects with external funding/buy-in needed
- High-risk initiatives requiring sign-off

**Solo founder validation is for:**
- Personal projects where you're the decision maker
- Situations where you have domain expertise
- Need to move fast without bureaucracy

**You still benefit from:**
- Forcing yourself to validate assumptions
- Talking to real users before building
- Creating a decision checkpoint (avoid wasting months)
- Documenting your thinking

**The key difference:**
- 1-2 days vs 1-2 weeks
- Informal vs formal
- Self-approval vs external sign-off
- "Good enough" validation vs exhaustive research

**This approach balances:**
- ✅ Speed (so you can start building)
- ✅ Rigor (so you're not building blindly)
- ✅ Pragmatism (appropriate for solo founder context)
