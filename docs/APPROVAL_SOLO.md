# PROJECT APPROVAL - Solo Founder Edition

**Project:** SGE - SaaS School Management System  
**Project Type:** Personal Initiative / Commercial SaaS Product  
**Owner:** Developer with educational domain expertise  
**Validation Period:** February 13-14, 2026  
**Status:** 🟡 IN VALIDATION  
**Decision Deadline:** End of February 14, 2026

---

## CONTEXT

This is a **personal SaaS initiative** to build a school management platform for:
1. **MVP Target:** Private schools in Costa Rica (single-tenant, $72K-108K ARR goal)
2. **Phase 2 Target:** Ministry of Public Education/MEP (multi-tenant, $1-2.5M contract potential)

**See:** [BUSINESS_MODEL.md](BUSINESS_MODEL.md) for full commercial strategy

**Validation Approach:** Streamlined 1-2 day process for solo founder (not formal stakeholder approval)  
**Reference:** [VALIDATION_EXPRESS.md](VALIDATION_EXPRESS.md) for detailed timeline

---

## WHY THIS CHECKPOINT MATTERS

Even without external stakeholders, a formal "go/no-go" decision prevents:
- ❌ Building for 6 months without market validation
- ❌ Ignoring red flags due to sunk cost fallacy
- ❌ Unclear commitment leading to half-hearted execution

**This is a commitment to yourself and your time.**

## EMERGENCY PIVOT TRIGGERS

**During Development, If:**
1. 2+ pilot schools drop out → Pause and reassess market fit
2. Technical hurdle adds >1 month → Reassess timeline or scope
3. Personal circumstances change → Adjust commitment or pause
4. Competitor launches similar product → Reassess differentiation

**Review this decision monthly - it's OK to pivot if circumstances change.**
