# Roadmap and Future Stages

**Commercial Strategy:** Private Schools (MVP) → Multi-School Platform → MEP Contract  
**Business Model:** B2B SaaS - See [BUSINESS_MODEL.md](BUSINESS_MODEL.md)  
**Timeline:** 2026-2028

This document outlines future stages beyond the MVP for growth, multi-school support, and AI capabilities, aligned with the go-to-market strategy for private schools and the Ministry of Public Education (MEP).

## COMMERCIAL CONTEXT

**Phase 1 (MVP - 2026):** Single-tenant SaaS for private schools (200-2000 students)  
- Target: 20-30 Costa Rican private schools by end of Year 1
- Revenue Goal: $72K-108K ARR
- Timeline: Feb-Aug 2026 development, Sep 2026 launch

**Phase 2 (Scale - 2027-2028):** Multi-tenant platform for 50-100+ schools  
- Target: Private schools + MEP pilot
- Revenue Goal: $270K-360K ARR + MEP contract potential ($1-2.5M)
- Timeline: Multi-tenant by Q2 2027, MEP RFP in 2028

See [BUSINESS_MODEL.md](BUSINESS_MODEL.md) for detailed commercial strategy and revenue projections.

## Stage A: Multi-School (Ministry or Networks)
**Timeline:** Q1-Q2 2027 (after 6-12 months with private schools)  
**Business Driver:** Required for MEP contract, enables scaling to 50-100+ schools  
**Revenue Impact:** Unlocks MEP opportunity ($1-2.5M contract potential)

Goal: Support multiple schools in a single platform with centralized governance.

Scope:
- Multi-school tenancy with strict data isolation
- Central admin roles (national, regional, institutional)
- Aggregated reporting across schools
- School-level branding and configuration per tenant
- Data import tools for legacy systems
- White-label capabilities for school groups

Outcomes:
- Enables ministry-level deployments (MEP)
- Supports public education networks
- Reduces hosting costs per school (economy of scale)
- Centralized updates and maintenance

## Stage B: Early-Warning Analytics (Dropout Prevention)
**Timeline:** Q3-Q4 2027 (before MEP RFP)  
**Business Driver:** Address MEP's #1 priority (reduce dropout rates)  
**Competitive Advantage:** Differentiation for government contract bids

Goal: Provide early warning signals for student dropout risks.

Signals (examples):
- Attendance decline trends (weekly and monthly)
- Repeated unexcused absences
- Sudden performance drop in key subjects
- Behavior or disciplinary flags (future input)

Actions:
- Alerts to coordinators and counselors
- Suggested intervention plans
- Follow-up tracking and outcomes
- Impact measurement (did intervention work?)

MEP Focus:
- Prioritize transparent criteria and explainable indicators
- Produce reports aligned to MEP requirements
- Demonstrate ROI: reduced dropout rates in pilot schools
- Privacy compliance (student data protection)

## Stage C: AI Modules
Goal: Enhance communication and insights without replacing human judgment.

Scope:
- Smart notification suggestions (tone, priority, best channel)
- Automated summaries of teacher observations
- Pattern detection for risk cases
- Recommendation engine for interventions

Safeguards:
- Human approval required for critical alerts
- Audit log of AI suggestions
- Bias monitoring and periodic review

## Stage D: Mobile App
Goal: Deliver a native experience for parents, students, and teachers.

Scope:
- Android app first, iOS later
- Push notifications (attendance, alerts, updates)
- Quick access to attendance, grades, and announcements
- Offline-friendly attendance capture (teacher mode)

## Dependencies
- Stable and versioned API contracts
- Robust permissions and audit logs
- Scalable infrastructure for multi-tenant deployment

## Notes
- These stages are optional and can be prioritized based on demand.
- All stages must align with privacy and public education compliance.
