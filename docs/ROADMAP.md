# Roadmap and Future Stages

This document outlines future stages beyond the MVP for growth, multi-school support, and AI capabilities.

## Stage A: Multi-School (Ministry or Networks)
Goal: Support multiple schools in a single platform with centralized governance.

Scope:
- Multi-school tenancy with strict data isolation
- Central admin roles (national, regional, institutional)
- Aggregated reporting across schools
- School-level branding and configuration per tenant
- Data import tools for legacy systems

Outcomes:
- Enables ministry-level deployments
- Supports public education networks

## Stage B: Early-Warning Analytics (Dropout Prevention)
Goal: Provide early warning signals for student dropout risks.

Signals (examples):
- Attendance decline trends (weekly and monthly)
- Repeated unexcused absences
- Sudden performance drop in key subjects
- Behavior or disciplinary flags (future input)

Actions:
- Alerts to coordinators and counselors
- Suggested intervention plans
- Follow-up tracking and outcomes

MEP Focus:
- Prioritize transparent criteria and explainable indicators
- Produce reports aligned to MEP requirements

## Stage C: AI Modules
Goal: Enhance communication and insights without replacing human judgment.

Scope:
- Smart notification suggestions (tone, priority, best channel)
- Automated summaries of teacher observations
- Pattern detection for risk cases
- Recommendation engine for interventions

Safeguards:
- Human approval required for critical alerts
- Audit log of AI suggestions
- Bias monitoring and periodic review

## Stage D: Mobile App
Goal: Deliver a native experience for parents, students, and teachers.

Scope:
- Android app first, iOS later
- Push notifications (attendance, alerts, updates)
- Quick access to attendance, grades, and announcements
- Offline-friendly attendance capture (teacher mode)

## Dependencies
- Stable and versioned API contracts
- Robust permissions and audit logs
- Scalable infrastructure for multi-tenant deployment

## Notes
- These stages are optional and can be prioritized based on demand.
- All stages must align with privacy and public education compliance.
